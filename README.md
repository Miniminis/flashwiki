## Hi, i am flashðŸ¦¥

In the past, i was working as a Project Manager at World Together Kenya, a Korea-based NGO. However, during my one-year-stay in Kenya, I became to witness the enormous positive influence of IT corporations and the changes that they bring about to local people. Since then, I have self-studied software development, and currently I am working as a Software Developer for about three years.

I am making products and developing softwares for everyone's fair shake on the earth. To make the world where people in Africa can get a good education through remote system, the world where people who have difficulties in reading can read with the help of a good software, and the world where people who work in rural area can participate in conference held in big cities, I will shorten the distances between people and make more opportunities using software development. I believe in the power of IT technology that makes better future.&#x20;
